## Requirements

The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a proprietary file that is *essential* to running ARMSX2. You must legally own a PS2 console to extract the BIOS.

## Extraction Procedure (Dumping)

Follow these steps to safely extract your console's BIOS:

### 1. Preparing the USB Flash Drive

1.  Download the **`biosdump.elf`** software from a reliable source.
2.  Copy the **`biosdump.elf`** file to the **root directory** of your USB stick.
3.  Insert the USB stick into the port on the PS2 console.

### 2. Running the Software

1.  Turn on your PS2 console.
2.  Launch **uLaunchELF** (or wLaunchELF) via your homebrew exploit (e.g. FMCB).
3.  In the uLaunchELF menu, navigate to **`mass:/`** (which represents your USB stick).
4.  Select and run the **`biosdump.elf`** file.

### 3. Completion of Dumping

  **The program is automatic.** Once started, the BIOS reading procedure begins automatically.

1.  Wait for the software to read and copy the BIOS. This is a quick process.
2.  When you see the confirmation message, the process is complete. The files have been saved to **`mass:/`** (your USB stick).
3.  Turn off your PS2 and remove the USB stick.

### 4. Transferring Files to PC

<Callout emoji="memo">
  **Important:** Copy *all* the generated files, not just the `.bin` file. They are all required for the emulator to function properly.
</Callout>

* Insert the USB stick into your PC.
* Copy the following extracted files (or all generated files) to a safe folder on your computer. Examples of files include:
    * `SCPH-XXXXX.MEC.bin` (The main BIOS)
    * `.nvm`
    * `.rom`
    * `.erom`

Once completed, you can point ARMSX2 to the folder containing these files to complete the initial setup.
