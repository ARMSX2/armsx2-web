## Game Disc & ISO Configuration

ARMSX2 is fully supported on **Android, iOS, WindowsARM, Linux, and macOS**. Using Disc Image Files (ISOs) is the preferred method for performance and stability across all platforms.

<Callout emoji="rocket">
  **Recommendation:** Always create and use **ISO files** from your original discs. This provides the best performance and avoids wear on physical media.

### 1. ISO Creation and Dumping

The initial step is creating a legal ISO image from your original PS2 game disc. The software used for this process varies by operating system.

<Columns cols={2}>
| Operating System | Recommended Tool/Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Windows** | **ImgBurn** or **DumpDisc** (via PS2 homebrew) |
| **Linux/macOS** | **`dd` command** or **`hdiutil` (Mac)** |
</Columns>

#### **Linux/macOS: Using the `dd` Command**

This command directly copies the raw data from the optical drive to an ISO file.

1.  Insert the PS2 game disc into your computer's optical drive.
2.  Open **Terminal**.
3.  First, **identify the device name** of your drive (e.g., `/dev/cdrom` or `/dev/disk2`). Use the command `diskutil list` (on Mac) or `lsblk` (on Linux).
4.  Execute the `dd` command, replacing the placeholders with your actual device name and desired save path:

    ```bash
    dd if=/dev/your-drive-name of=/path/to/save/game.iso
    ```

<Callout emoji="memo">
  Ensure all your final ISO files are stored in a **single, dedicated folder** (e.g., `Documents/ARMSX2/isos`).

### 2. Configure the ISO Directory

You must set the folder path for your game files in the emulator settings so ARMSX2 can list them.

1.  Open ARMSX2.
2.  Navigate to **Settings**, then select **Folders**.
3.  Click **Add** and locate the folder containing all your ISO files (e.g., `Documents/ARMSX2/isos`).
4.  Confirm the selection and press **OK**.
5.  All your games will automatically populate the **Game List** on the main screen.

### 3. Launching a Game

Once configured, launching the game is platform-independent:

1.  **Double-click** the desired game title in the **Game List**.
2.  ARMSX2 will use the **quick boot feature** to start the game directly, bypassing the PS2 BIOS screen.

### 4. Loading from a Physical Disc (Alternative)

This method is less stable but can be used if your computer has a supported optical drive.

1.  Insert the original PS2 disc into your computer's drive.
2.  In ARMSX2, go to **Settings**, then **CDVD**, and select **Disk (Physical Drive)**.
3.  Go to the **System** menu and choose **Boot CDVD (full)**.

<Callout emoji="warning">
  Physical disc loading is often **slower and less reliable**. If you encounter performance issues, switch back to the **ISO loading method**.
